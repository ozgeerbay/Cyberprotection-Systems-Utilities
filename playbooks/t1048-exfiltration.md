# Exfiltration (T1048)

## Objective
Analyse data exfiltration behaviour generated by Atomic Red Team and its detection in Wazuh.

## Execution context
- Platform: Linux VM
- Tool: Atomic Red Team
- Technique: T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol)

## Expected detection (Wazuh)
Primary rule groups expected to alert:
- Network activity
- Data exfiltration
- Suspicious outbound connections

## Analysis steps
1. Run ART test #4 for T1048.
2. Inspect Wazuh alerts around execution time.
3. Identify:
   - source process
   - destination IP / protocol
   - alert rule group and severity
4. Correlate alert timestamp with ART execution.

## Observations
- Exfiltration attempts generate outbound network activity.
- Detection depends on network telemetry and agent visibility.

## Conclusion
Wazuh is able to highlight abnormal data transfer behaviour when sufficient network or system-level telemetry is available.
